Antorcha - A LED-based signal device
====================================

...


Directory placement
-------------------

Antorcha makes extensive use of libraries and header of the ben-wpan
project. For this, the top-level directory of the ben-wpan project must
be in the same directory as the top-level directory of Antorcha. E.g.,

/home/qi/ben-wpan/
/home/qi/antorcha/


Avrdude configuration
---------------------

Antorcha uses the atusb programming adapter from the ben-wpan project.
Since the pin positions of MISO and MOSI are swapped between ATmega32U2
and the ATmega168, we use a modified configuration entry.

It is passed to avrdude via the new -L option, available with the
Nanonote patches at
