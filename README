Antorcha - A LED-based signal device
====================================

...


Directory placement
-------------------

Antorcha makes extensive use of libraries and header of the ben-wpan
project. For this, the top-level directory of the ben-wpan project must
be in the same directory as the top-level directory of Antorcha. E.g.,

/home/qi/ben-wpan/
/home/qi/antorcha/


/etc/avrdude.conf entry
-----------------------

Antorcha uses the atusb programming adapter from the ben-wpan project.
Since the pin positions of MISO and MOSI are swapped between ATmega32U2
and the ATmega168, the following entry is needed in avrdude.conf (which
is the same as the entry for nanonote_atusb except that the pin numbers
for mosi and miso are swapped):

programmer
  id	= "nanonote_antorcha";
  desc	= "NanoNote 8:10 card adapter for ATUSB";
  type	= nanonote;
  reset	= 1;
  sck	= 8;
  mosi	= 6;
  miso	= 7;
  pgmled = 2;
;
